TestMob is a distributed unit test system loosely based on <a href="http://ejohn.org">John Resig&apos;s</a> project <a href="http://testswarm.com">TestSwarm</a>.  Manual unit testing Javascript across a variety of OS&apos;s, browsers and devices is a very time consuming process.  TestMob allows many clients to join the mob. As soon as a request to kick off a test comes in, all available clients begin to run the tests.  When a client completes the suite the results are sent back to the initiator.
